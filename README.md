# ComplexNetworkSim

ComplexNetworkSim is a Python package for the simulation of agents connected in a complex network.

## Introduction  

The framework can can create a virtual complex network with virtual agents
that can interact with each other. This can be used for example to study
the spread of an epidemic over this simulated network and compare it
with a phenomenon in the real world. Agent-based simulation tools
generally operate on a simple topology such as grids or lattices, but
this framework goes beyond this limitation by providing support for
simulation over complex topologies (i.e. any kind of non-regularly 
connected graph). In addition, this project is not 
limited to a static network, but also takes into account temporal
networks, where processes can dynamically change the underlying network
structure over time.

## Maintenance of the project and support

This project was created in 2010-2011 and since then not actively developed anymore. Upon request I put the code on github in February 2014. If you would like to improve the project, feel free to fork it and submit a pull request. I'll then try to keep the version on PyPi up-to-date. You can also reach me by email on ![my first name dot my last name #AT# gmail dot com](docs/email.png)
